	      To calculate your <strong>pace</strong>, you can enter the <strong>distance</strong> you ran and the <strong>time</strong> it took you to run it, while leaving the pace field empty. You can calculate distance or time by filling in the other two forms in the same way.

		<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though runners often fall into their natural pace when running, keeping control of your pace during a run is an important factor in getting the most out of your exercise and training.
		</p>
		<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Going too fast in the beginning can tire you out, slowing down your times in the later sections. And going too slow can unnecessarily save energy that could be spent on a better time. Some runners swear by an 'easy' or 'recovery' pace for most of their runs, while others enjoy harder paces to push themselves to a better time. 
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's up to you to decide which method works best for you and what you want to get out of your run. Play around with the calculator above to find out what pace will get you what time/distance, and vis versa.
